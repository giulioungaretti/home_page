# intro
Anaconda is awesome. Ipython 2.0 dev is awesome (modal interface *FTW*).
But you don't want to mess with your always working stable release.
Since Anaconda uses its own environments and not the usual virtualenv, the commands are very easy.
# action
I assume you have already installed anaconda on your system.
- Create a new conda environment   (with all the dependencies for IPython):
{% highlight bash %}
 conda create -n ipython-dev ipython-notebook ipython-qtconsole
 conda remove -n ipython-dev ipython #extra clean
{% endhighlight %}
- activate the conda enviroment and install setuptools for future use
{% highlight bash %}
source activate ipython-dev
conda install setuptools
{% endhighlight %}
- clone the repo to any folder you like
{% highlight bash %}
cd ~/.opt # select the one you like
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ipython/ipython.git
cd ipython  # assuming you didn't pass anything extra to git clone
python setupegg.py develop # so you can git pull at any time
{% endhighlight %}

now you are ready to go!
